# Vertex Buffer
Create a vertex buffer to push the vertices instead of hardcoding them.

## Vertex Input description
We will start by updating the vertex shader to include per-vertex inputPosition and inputColor properties.

We create a new Vertex class to hold the vertex data and populate it.

Then we need to inform the Vulkan how to upload the data in the GPU, we do this with an inputBinding Description.
We need to specify the binding "location", sizeof the data and the inputRate which can of 2 types
    - Vertex: Move to the next data entry after each vertex
    - Instace: Move to the next data entry after each instace.

Then we need to create the Input Attribute Description to describe how to handle vertex input.
We are going to create 2 attribute descriptions because we send 2 item, the position and the colour.
We need to specify the binding, location, format and offset.
The format is what type should we map in shader.
The offset is the number of bytes we need to offset to get to the attribute we need.

Lastly, we need to supply this to the pipeline so that Vulkan can send the appropriate information to the shader.
